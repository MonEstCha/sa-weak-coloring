Simulated Annealing for Weak Coloring

This repository contains the source code for the Simulated Annealing procedure and the Python script for analyzing several logfiles or a single one. Logfiles are written by the Simulated Annealing procedure at the end of a run. 
Note: A directory 'log' should be present in the working directory or the path to the logfile be adapted.
The files Header, ReadText and FlagParser were taken from Nadara et al. (2019) and adapted for the purposes of this Bachelor thesis.
